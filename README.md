# QRCipher
**ENCRYPTION AND QR GENERATION SYSTEM**

QRCipher is a secure desktop application developed in Java (NetBeans Java SE 23) designed for basic encryption, decryption, and QR code generation. Featuring a simple GUI built with `JFrame` and utilizing the `ZXing` library, QRCipher provides essential tools for secure file handling and data encoding.  
This project serves as the **final requirement for the Programming course (CSCC3)** at Wesleyan University Philippines – Aurora Campus.
